      We've given you a couple of files and a very basic schema to get you
      started. Check them out and have a read through the comments throughout
      the application files.


      For now we only support markdown files, but in the near future we'll open
      that up to whatever structured format you like!


      You're looking at the main landing page, it's a markdown file which you
      can find at "content/marketing-pages/index.md".


      This page is admittedly pretty boring, but what's neat about it is that
      you can actually edit the content right here from the context of your
      website. Click on the "Edit Page" tab in the top-right corner to get
      started!


      We've built a few pages for you to get started, take a look around and see
      if you can figure out how to build your own pages and templates.

    diagramDescription: >-
      Here is the architecture for this Next.js app. When deployed, your admin
      routes will be protected by the Tina wrapper, which requires you to
      authenticate with Tina Cloud. Otherwise, the non-admin page and the admin
      page should be identical, using the same query and rendering the same
      components.
